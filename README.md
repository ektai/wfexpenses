# PURDM - Your Own Expense Manager (wfexpenses)

Purrrr...diem. PURDM is a open source expense manager/host it yourself solution web application. It allows you 
to host your own expense manager that you can access via web and mobile application.
This means you have full control of your data and not some other company. You can delete your application
and all your data will be gone. Keep companies out of your business with PURDM.

get started hosting your own expense manager.

The following files must be writable by the server. Give the 
appropriate permissions

## Development 

Download this repo or use this link [here](https://github.com/wyntonfranklin/wfexpenses.git)
You need to download Yii and add it to the repo you downloaded. You can access
a copy of the Yii version I used [here](https://wfspace.sfo2.digitaloceanspaces.com/yii.zip).

**Requirements**
* Yii 1.1
* PHP
* MySQL
* Grunt
* Node
* Npm

### Steps

* First download the repo giving the link provided.
* Insure you have in your PHP version the required server requirements listed above.
You also need to have node js installed on your computer.
* Download the Yii version via the link provided [here](https://wfspace.sfo2.digitaloceanspaces.com/yii.zip).
Place the extracted version of yii in your base directory. The name of the folder should be yii.
* Download the extensions required to run this application from [here](https://wfspace.sfo2.digitaloceanspaces.com/extensions.zip)
These extensions you download will be required to run your application properly. Place the extensions in your protected folder under the folder name
extensions.
* In your database create a database to hold your application.
* Run `npm` install from your base directory to add the packages required to develop.
* Once you do this you can run the `grunt` command in your base folder.
* Create a folder called `assets` in your base directory.
* Create a folder called `runtime` in your protected directory.
* Setup your configuration path for your server or virtual host. An example can be found below.

```html
<VirtualHost *:80>
    DocumentRoot "C:\Users\wfranklin\Documents\GitHub\wfexpenses"
    ServerName demo.wfexpenses.com
    ServerAlias demo.wfexpenses.com
    <Directory "C:\Users\wfranklin\Documents\GitHub\wfexpenses"> 
        RewriteEngine on
        RewriteRule ^index.php/ - [L,R=404]
        RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
        RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
        RewriteRule . index.php
        AllowOverride All
        Require all Granted        
        AllowOverride All
        Require all Granted
    </Directory>
</VirtualHost>
```
* Head to your base domain and run the setup.
* If you need further directions on running a `yii 1.1` version app check out this tutorial [here](https://app.wftutorials.com/tutorial/111).
You can look at the **directory structure** and **additional configurations** chapters for more insight.

### Known issues
When running in a windows environment you might need to update the `create_dist.sh` code or make some changes to it.
The `tar` command needs to be `tar --force-local -rf`. This is so that semicolons work.
